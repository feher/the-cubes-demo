Hi,

Here you can find my solution of the assignment for the SW Engineer position
at Rightware.

This assignment was a lot of fun to work on. I could go on adding features
forever :)
I hope you will like it as much as I liked working on it.

As requested, this is a small demo according to the following description:

[QUOTE]

Create a 3D user interface with the following features:
- Use OpenGL or OpenGL ES 2.0 for rendering
- Per pixel shading
- Dynamic number of 3D objects in a scene
- 3D objects can be simple generated models (e.g. box or sphere)
- 3D picking to recognize if user has clicked a 3D object
- 3D button to add objects: Clicking it adds a new 3D object to the scene
- Clicking any other 3D object deletes it from the scene
- Third party libraries can be used, but picking and rendering should be
own code

[END QUOTE]

All the required features are implemented and functional.
I also added a few extra animations, decorations and controls.
The source code is in C++ and GLSL. I've put the emphasis on clarity of code.
It is written and organized in a way that supports maintainability, modularity
and extensibility.

You can find more detailed information in the README.txt file.

I am looking forward to hearing from you!

Thank you,
Gabor Fekete
